    "## Q3. How do you interpret the coefficients of a Lasso Regression model?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lasso Regression** (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) modifies the standard linear regression by adding an L1 regularization term. The interpretation of Lasso Regression coefficients involves understanding both their values and the effects of regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interpreting Coefficients in Lasso Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Coefficient Magnitude**:\n",
    "   - **General Interpretation**: Each coefficient represents the change in the response variable for a one-unit change in the corresponding predictor, holding all other predictors constant.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Feature Selection**:\n",
    "   - **Zero Coefficients**: In Lasso Regression, some coefficients may be exactly zero. Features with zero coefficients are effectively excluded from the model, indicating that they do not contribute to predicting the response variable.\n",
    "   - **Sparse Model**: The presence of zero coefficients simplifies the model by retaining only the most important predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Impact of Regularization Parameter λ**:\n",
    "   - **High λ**: A larger λ increases the penalty, leading to more coefficients being shrunk towards zero or set to zero. This results in a more regularized and sparse model.\n",
    "   - **Low λ**: A smaller λ results in less regularization, and coefficients are closer to those found in an ordinary least squares (OLS) model.\n",

    "## Q4. What are the tuning parameters that can be adjusted in Lasso Regression, and how do they affect the model's performance?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lasso Regression** involves several key tuning parameters that influence its performance. The most critical parameter is the regularization parameter 𝜆, but other aspects can also impact the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Tuning Parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Regularization Parameter 𝜆**:\n",
    "   - **Description**: This is the primary tuning parameter in Lasso Regression, which controls the strength of the L1 penalty applied to the coefficients.\n",
    "   - **Effect on Model**:\n",
    "     - **Higher 𝜆**: Increases the penalty, which shrinks more coefficients towards zero. This leads to a sparser model with fewer features but might also increase bias.\n",
    "     - **Lower 𝜆**: Reduces the penalty, allowing more coefficients to remain non-zero. This may improve the model's ability to capture the true relationships but can also increase variance and risk of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature Scaling**:\n",
    "   - **Description**: Although not a tuning parameter per se, standardizing or normalizing features is important for Lasso Regression.\n",
    "   - **Effect on Model**:\n",
    "     - **Scaling**: Ensures that all features are on a comparable scale, which allows the L1 penalty to be applied uniformly across features. Without scaling, features with larger magnitudes might disproportionately influence the regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Solver and Optimization Settings**:\n",
    "   - **Description**: Different solvers can be used for fitting Lasso Regression models, such as coordinate descent, least angle regression (LARS), or gradient descent.\n",
    "   - **Effect on Model**:\n",
    "     - **Solver Choice**: Affects the efficiency and speed of fitting the model. Some solvers may handle large datasets or specific types of data more efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Impact on Model Performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Regularization Parameter 𝜆**:\n",
    "  - **Model Complexity**: Higher 𝜆 values simplify the model by reducing the number of features but may increase bias. Lower 𝜆 values allow the model to use more features, potentially increasing variance.\n",

    "## Q5. Can Lasso Regression be used for non-linear regression problems? If yes, how?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lasso Regression** is inherently a linear regression technique, which means it models the relationship between predictors and the response variable using a linear function. However, it can be adapted to handle non-linear regression problems through feature engineering and transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using Lasso Regression for Non-Linear Problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Feature Engineering**:\n",
    "   - **Polynomial Features**: By including polynomial terms e.g., ( x^2, x^3 ) of the predictors, Lasso Regression can model non-linear relationships. For instance, if the relationship between the predictors and the response is quadratic, adding squared terms allows the model to capture this non-linearity.\n",
    "   - **Interaction Terms**: Including interaction terms e.g., ( x_1 times x_2 ) can help capture more complex relationships between predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Kernel Methods**:\n",
    "   - **Kernel Trick**: Although Lasso Regression itself is not a kernel method, you can use kernel transformations to map data into a higher-dimensional space where non-linear relationships become linear. The transformed data can then be used in Lasso Regression. However, this approach is more common in algorithms specifically designed for kernel methods, like Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with kernels.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Non-Linear Basis Functions**:\n",
    "   - **Splines and Basis Functions**: Using non-linear basis functions or splines can capture complex relationships. You can transform your predictors using such functions and then apply Lasso Regression to the transformed features.\n",

    "2. **Feature Selection**:\n",
    "   - **Ridge Regression**: Does not perform feature selection. It reduces the magnitude of coefficients but keeps all features in the model.\n",
    "   - **Lasso Regression**: Performs feature selection by setting some coefficients to zero, effectively excluding some features from the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Handling Multicollinearity**:\n",

    "\n",
    "5. **Computational Complexity**:\n",
    "   - **Ridge Regression**: Generally easier to compute as the optimization problem is smoother and more straightforward.\n",
