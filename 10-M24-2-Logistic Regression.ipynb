        "\n",
        "**Precision** and **Recall** are two essential metrics used to evaluate the performance of a classification model, particularly in the context of handling positive and negative classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **1. Precision**:\n",
        "- **Definition**: Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive instances (True Positives) to the total number of instances that were predicted as positive (True Positives + False Positives). It answers the question: *Of all the instances that the model predicted as positive, how many were actually positive?*\n",
        "- **Formula**:\n",
        "  $$\n",
        "  \\text{Precision} = \\frac{TP}{TP + FP}\n",

        "  - **Use Case**: Precision is important when the cost of **False Positives (FP)** is high. For example, in spam detection, you want to minimize false positives because classifying legitimate emails as spam can lead to important messages being missed.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **2. Recall** (also known as **Sensitivity** or **True Positive Rate**):\n",
        "- **Definition**: Recall is the ratio of correctly predicted positive instances (True Positives) to all actual positive instances (True Positives + False Negatives). It answers the question: *Of all the actual positive instances, how many did the model correctly identify?*\n",

        "\n",
        "#### **Precision vs. Recall Trade-off**:\n",
        "- **Precision** focuses on how correct the positive predictions are, while **Recall** focuses on how well the model finds all the actual positives.\n",
        "- There is often a trade-off between precision and recall:\n",
        "  - Increasing **precision** can reduce **recall** because the model may become more conservative in making positive predictions (trying to avoid false positives).\n",
        "  - Increasing **recall** can reduce **precision** because the model may make more positive predictions, increasing the likelihood of false positives.\n",

        "- **Precision**: Of all the emails predicted as spam, how many are truly spam?\n",
        "- **Recall**: Of all the actual spam emails, how many were successfully identified by the model?\n",

        "The appropriate balance between precision and recall depends on the specific problem. For instance, in spam detection, you may prioritize precision to avoid important emails being marked as spam. In contrast, for detecting a serious medical condition, you may prioritize recall to ensure all true cases are identified.\n",

        "**Logistic regression** is traditionally a binary classification algorithm, used to predict the probability of an instance belonging to one of two classes. However, there are ways to extend logistic regression to handle **multiclass classification** problems. The two main techniques are **One-vs-Rest (OvR)** and **Softmax Regression (Multinomial Logistic Regression)**.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 1. **One-vs-Rest (OvR) Approach**:\n",
        "The **One-vs-Rest (OvR)**, also known as **One-vs-All (OvA)**, is a strategy that converts a multiclass classification problem into multiple binary classification problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### **How it works**:\n",
        "- For a classification problem with **N** classes, OvR trains **N** separate binary classifiers.\n",
        "  - Each classifier is trained to distinguish one class from the rest (all other classes combined).\n",
        "  - For class **i**, the classifier predicts whether the instance belongs to class **i** or not (all other classes are treated as the negative class).\n",
        "  \n",
        "- During prediction:\n",
        "  - Each classifier outputs a probability score for its corresponding class.\n",
        "  - The class with the highest predicted probability is chosen as the final class.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### **Example**:\n",
        "For a problem with 3 classes (A, B, and C):\n",

        "  1. Classifier 1: Class A vs. (Class B and Class C)\n",

        "  \n",
        "- For a new instance, all three classifiers predict a probability, and the class with the highest probability is selected as the final prediction.\n",
