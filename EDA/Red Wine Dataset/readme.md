## EDA with Red Wine Dataset

### Overview

This directory contains the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Red Wine Quality dataset. The dataset provides various chemical properties of red wine, which are used to predict the quality of the wine. This analysis aims to explore the relationships between these properties and wine quality to gain insights into the factors that influence wine quality.

### Dataset Description

The dataset includes the following features:

1. **Fixed Acidity**: Influences the wine's crispness and balance.
2. **Volatile Acidity**: Affects taste; higher levels make wine unpleasant.
3. **Citric Acid**: Adds freshness and preserves flavor.
4. **Residual Sugar**: Impacts sweetness; higher levels mean sweeter wine.
5. **Chlorides**: Affects taste; higher levels make wine salty.
6. **Free Sulfur Dioxide**: Preserves wine from spoilage.
7. **Total Sulfur Dioxide**: Affects taste and prevents oxidation.
8. **Density**: Reflects sugar and alcohol content.
9. **pH**: Controls acidity and preservation.
10. **Sulphates**: Preserves wine and enhances taste.
11. **Alcohol**: Impacts the wine's body and quality.
12. **Quality**: The target variable, indicating the quality of wine on a scale.

### Steps Followed for EDA

1. **Data Import and Initial Exploration**:
   - Imported the dataset and conducted an initial review to understand its structure.
   - Analyzed the summary statistics to gain an overview of the data distribution.

2. **Feature Analysis**:
   - Investigated key features like acidity, alcohol content, and sulphates to understand their impact on wine quality.
   - Visualized the distribution of each feature to identify patterns and potential outliers.

3. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Examined the correlation between different chemical properties and wine quality.
   - Used heatmaps and pair plots to visualize the relationships between variables.

4. **Handling Missing Data**:
   - Discussed various imputation techniques such as mean/median imputation, mode imputation, and the option to drop missing data.
   - Evaluated the pros and cons of each method in the context of the dataset.

5. **Outlier Detection and Treatment**:
   - Identified potential outliers using box plots.
   - Considered the impact of outliers on the analysis and suggested appropriate methods to handle them.

## Key Findings

- **Alcohol Content**: Higher alcohol content generally correlates with better quality wine.
- **Sulphates**: A moderate amount of sulphates contributes positively to wine quality.
- **Residual Sugar**: While not a strong predictor of quality, wines with balanced sugar levels are often better received.

These insights can guide winemakers in optimizing the chemical properties of their products to enhance quality.
