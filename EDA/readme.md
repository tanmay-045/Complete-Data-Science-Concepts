## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Cleaning, and Feature Engineering

Welcome to this repository, which contains datasets and corresponding analysis. This repository demonstrates the work done while performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Cleaning, and Feature Engineering on various datasets.

### Repository Structure

- **Datasets**: Contains various datasets in `.csv` and `.xlsx` formats (necessary links are provided to download directly from sources as I don't own any of them). 
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: The `.ipynb` files contain step-by-step analysis and code for EDA, data cleaning, and feature engineering. Each notebook includes:
  - Data loading and inspection
  - Handling missing values and outliers
  - Exploratory analysis with visualizations
  - Feature selection and extraction for model preparation

### Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python**: Core programming language used.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For feature engineering.

### How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   ```
2. Install the necessary dependencies by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter notebooks to explore the analysis performed on each dataset.
