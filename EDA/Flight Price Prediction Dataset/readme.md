## EDA on Flight Price Dataset

### Overview

This repository contains the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Cleaning work performed on a flight price dataset. The dataset was analyzed to identify key trends, anomalies, and insights that could be useful for further analysis or modeling.

### Dataset Description

The dataset includes information on flight prices, features related to flights, and other relevant attributes. It is intended to help understand factors influencing flight prices and identify patterns that can guide further analysis.

## Steps Followed for EDA

1. **Data Loading:** Imported the dataset using `pandas` and performed initial inspection.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Addressed missing values and inconsistencies where necessary. 
3. **Data Exploration:** Conducted summary statistics, visualized distributions, and examined relationships between variables.
4. **Feature Analysis:** Investigated key features affecting flight prices and their impact.
5. **Outlier Detection:** Identified and handled any outliers or anomalies in the data.
6. **Trend Analysis:** Analyzed trends to understand patterns in flight prices over time or other dimensions.

## Key Findings

- **Observation 1:** The 3rd month, **March**, has the highest average, meaning more people travel during March, followed by the 5th month, **May**.
- **Observation 2:** **Jet Airways** shows the highest average flight prices, closely followed by **Multiple Carriers Premium Economy**, indicating a premium pricing strategy.
- **Observation 3:** A positive correlation is observed between **flight duration** and **price**, where longer flight hours consistently result in higher costs.
- **Observation 4:** Flight prices increase proportionally with the number of stops. Notably, flights with **4 stops** have an average cost of **₹17,686**, while **non-stop flights** are significantly cheaper, averaging **₹5,024.90**.

These findings are based on detailed analysis and visualizations present in the notebook files.

***I have also conducted two case studies using the same dataset, each employing a distinct approach to analyze the data. These case studies provided insights tailored to different business requirements.***
