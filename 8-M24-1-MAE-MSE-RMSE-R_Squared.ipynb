    "## Q1. Explain the concept of R-squared in linear regression models. How is it calculated, and what does it represent?\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared (R²) is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables in a linear regression model. It indicates how well the regression model fits the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calculation:\n",
    "R² is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "R^2 = 1 - { (SS_res) / (SS_tot) }\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- (SS_res) is the sum of squares of residuals (difference between observed and predicted values).\n",
    "- (SS_tot) is the total sum of squares (difference between observed values and the mean of observed values).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation:\n",
    "- **R² = 1**: The model perfectly explains the variance.\n",
    "- **R² = 0**: The model does not explain any variance, similar to using the mean as the predictor.\n",
    "- **Higher R²** values indicate a better fit, but an overly high value might indicate overfitting."

    "\n",
    "Adjusted R-squared is a modified version of R-squared that adjusts for the number of predictors in a regression model. It accounts for the model complexity and only increases if the new predictor improves the model more than would be expected by chance.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Q7. How do regularized linear models help to prevent overfitting in machine learning? Provide an example to illustrate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regularized linear models** help prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function, discouraging overly complex models with large coefficients. This reduces the model’s variance and improves its ability to generalize to unseen data, balancing the trade-off between **bias** and **variance**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How it Works:\n",
    "In regularized models like **Ridge** and **Lasso**, the objective function minimizes both the residual sum of squares (RSS) and a penalty term based on the magnitude of the model coefficients:\n",
    "- **Ridge Regression** adds an L_2 penalty (sum of squared coefficients).\n",
    "- **Lasso Regression** adds an L_2 penalty (sum of absolute coefficients).\n",
    "\n",
    "These penalties shrink the coefficients, making the model less sensitive to small variations in the training data, which is a key cause of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "Consider a linear regression model trained on a dataset with 100 features. Without regularization, the model might assign large weights to each feature, even those that contribute little to the prediction, fitting the noise in the data. This can lead to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, applying **Ridge** or **Lasso** regularization:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ridge**: By penalizing large coefficients, Ridge reduces the importance of less informative features, ensuring that the model does not fit the noise.\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. **Lasso**: Lasso might even shrink some coefficients to zero, effectively performing **feature selection** by eliminating irrelevant features, further simplifying the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Visual Illustration:\n",
    "- Without regularization, the model's decision boundary may be too flexible, fitting the noise (overfitting).\n",
    "- With regularization, the decision boundary becomes smoother and better suited for generalizing to new data (avoiding overfitting).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "\n",

    "- **Limitation**: Regularization introduces bias by shrinking the coefficients, which may result in underfitting, especially when the true relationship between the features and the target variable is complex.\n",
    "- **Why it matters**: In situations where the model needs to capture non-linear patterns, regularized linear models may oversimplify the relationship, reducing predictive accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Feature Selection (Lasso)**:\n",
    "- **Limitation**: While Lasso performs feature selection by shrinking some coefficients to zero, it can be unstable when features are highly correlated (multicollinearity). It might arbitrarily select one feature over another, even though both are equally relevant.\n",
    "- **Why it matters**: In cases of multicollinearity, Ridge regression, which retains all features, may be more appropriate. However, neither approach may be ideal for complex or highly interdependent datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Assumption of Linearity**:\n",
    "- **Limitation**: Regularized linear models assume a linear relationship between the predictors and the target variable.\n",
    "- **Why it matters**: If the data exhibits non-linear patterns, these models may not perform well, even with regularization. More flexible models like decision trees, random forests, or neural networks might capture non-linear relationships better.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Tuning of Regularization Parameter `lambda`**:\n",
    "- **Limitation**: The performance of regularized models heavily depends on choosing an appropriate value of the regularization parameter `lambda`. Incorrect tuning can lead to underfitting or overfitting.\n",
    "- **Why it matters**: Cross-validation is often required to tune `lambda`, adding computational complexity and making the model more difficult to interpret.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Interpretability**:\n",
    "- **Limitation**: As regularization shrinks coefficients, it may reduce the interpretability of the model. In Lasso, by driving coefficients to zero, it can oversimplify feature importance.\n",
